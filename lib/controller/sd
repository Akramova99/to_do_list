It seems like you are working on a Flutter application using the GetX package for state management. Your ShowIcons class is a controller that manages the display of tasks and icons based on different task groups like "Daily Study", "Work", and "Profile". Let's break down and refine your code to ensure clarity and functionality.

Here are some key points and improvements for your ShowIcons class:

Initialization of Observables: You are using .obs on lists and other variables, which is correct for reactive state management in GetX.

Method to Update Icons and Task List: Your iconChange method fetches tasks and updates the icon and list based on the task group. Make sure that SaveAddProject.getTasks() correctly fetches the tasks asynchronously.

ListView Builder within Obx: The Obx widget is used correctly to reactively build the list view as the showList updates. Ensure that the allTaskView method correctly handles the display of each task item.

Handling Date Changes: The handling of date changes with calendar.changeSelectedDate(selectedDate); is mentioned, but it's unclear how this impacts the task list or icons. This needs to be integrated more clearly if it affects what tasks are shown.

Here is a refined version of your code with some improvements for readability and functionality:

dart





Make sure the data types and method implementations align with your actual app structure, especially for the parts where I assumed the implementation details (like Task class and SaveAddProject.getTasks()).

If you need further customization or encounter specific issues, feel free to ask!
